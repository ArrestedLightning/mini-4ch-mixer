# Mini 4 Channel Audio Mixer

A very simple active audio mixer with 4 3.5mm inputs, and 1 3.5mm output.  USB-powered.  The default gain is 1:1 on all channels, although this can be changed by altering resistor values and/or installing potentiometers.  I built this as a simple way to run multiple sources into a set of computer speakers.  It is designed to fit in a commonly-available 90x70x28mm enclosure with end panels that can be either laser-cut or made from PCBs.
